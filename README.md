# Code for the paper "Self-supervised Disentanglement Learning with Composition Invariance"

This code is based on [Disentangling Correlated Factors via Hausdorff Factorized Support](https://github.com/karroth/disentangling-correlated-factors). Please refer to this repository to complete the training and testing environment configuration.

## Quick Start

You can easily train and test the model using the provided shell scripts:

```bash
# Train the model
./multi_run_dsprites.sh


Make sure the scripts have execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x multi_run_*.sh
```

The scripts will automatically handle multiple runs with different configurations
